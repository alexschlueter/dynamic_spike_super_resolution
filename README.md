### Dynamic Spikes Super-Resolution
<i> By Francisco Romero and Timothee Wintz. </i>

v0.1

Codes to generate the examples presented in the paper <b>Dynamic Spike Super-Resolution
with Applications to Ultrafast Ultrasound</b>, authored by Giovanni Alberti, Habib Ammari,
Francisco Romero and Timoth√©e Wintz.

The codes require the SparseInverProblems solver from https://github.com/nboyd/SparseInverseProblems.jl, we imported it and included small modifications that let it abort to avoid entering infinite loops.


There are simulations in one and two dimensions, the parameters to generate them can be modified in the
files 1d_parameters.jl and 2d_parameters.jl respectively. The script to generate them are Main_1dSim.jl 
and Main_2dSim.jl respectively.
Be advised: generation of examples is lengthy and it is recommended to use run these scripts in a parallel fashion.

The generated data is stored in "/data", organized by type of simulation and date of it.

The scripts to generate the figures with the results are plots_1d_results.py and plots_2d_results.py respectively. 
Inside these scripts, at the beggining, it is possible to change the example to simulate (in /data).
