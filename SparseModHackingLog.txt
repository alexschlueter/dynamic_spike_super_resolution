25/01/18 : Made the sparse solver locally to be able to hack it and paralelize it. To avoid confics with the installed module, I included the path in the Main file as:
push!(LOAD_PATH, "./SparseInverseProblems/src")

and changed the module's name to SparseInverseProblemsMod, this included modifications on files:

SparseInverseProblems -> SparseInverseProblemsMod
BoxConstrainedDifferentiableModel.jl
SuperResModels.jl
Main_1dSim.jl
Utils.jl
BoxConstrainedDifferentiableModel.jl

%% Code modifications to see what happens

SparseInverseProblems/src/util/ip.jl :

Added LoopingIndex, LoopingIndex2 and a kill switch to active if looping intesifies.
